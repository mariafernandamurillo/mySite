        <p>Fernanda was born in May 31<sup>st</sup> 1992 in Ensenada, Baja California, México. She was the fourth child of Tomas and Mercedes and the youngest sister of Luz, Tomas, and Ariana. Her childhood was like the other children at the time; play outside with no computers (and no Internet). However, when Fernanda was nine years old meet for the first time a computer. Since that day, she thought, <i>“I want to study something related to computers when I grow up”</i>.
